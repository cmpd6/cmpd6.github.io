Human behavior refers to the way humans act and interact with each other. It is moderated by factors like cultural values, individual attitudes, politics, religion, and genetic make-up. In this seminar, I will present three different epidemic models that include human behavior from Ebola to Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and COVID-19. One of these behaviors is influenced by cultural practices, another by risky behaviors, and the third is moderated by public sentiment. I will show how we accounted for these behaviors from simply using a parameter to using approaches from social sciences to using Twitter data to quantify functional forms for public sentiment. I will close by exploring the role of these behaviors on disease propagation.
