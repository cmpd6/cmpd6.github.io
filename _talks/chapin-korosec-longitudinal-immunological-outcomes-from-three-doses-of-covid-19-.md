People living with HIV (PLWH) older than age 55 have an enhanced risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is further unclear whether multiple standard doses of COVID-19 vaccines elicit a durable immunity in this population or whether the vaccines can destabilize HIV reservoirs. In this talk I will discuss our unpublished work where we followed n = 91 PLWH aged 55+ and n = 23 age-matched HIV- individuals over a period of 48 weeks following COVID-19 dose one, capturing longitudinal immunological outcomes from two subsequent booster doses.  I will introduce the longitudinal immunological findings for IgG, memory-B cells, and cytokines (IFNg and IL2). I will then motivate our novel within-host immunological model which couples these quantities together, and the findings of our fits to determine dose-dependent decay rates and half life values.  Model fit findings, practical identifiability concerns, and biological implications of the within-host modelling approach will be discussed.
