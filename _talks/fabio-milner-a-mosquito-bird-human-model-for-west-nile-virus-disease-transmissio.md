An infection-age structured model is proposed and analyzed to describe the transmission dynamics of West Nile Virus disease in human and bird populations. The model consists of a coupled system of partial differential equations with nonlocal boundary conditions, similar in structure to the Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model of 1927. We prove the well-posedness of the model and also the stability of the disease-free equilibrium under the classical threshold condition for the net reproductive number R_0 is less than 1. We show some data-based simulations contrasting results from regions with very different weather patterns.
