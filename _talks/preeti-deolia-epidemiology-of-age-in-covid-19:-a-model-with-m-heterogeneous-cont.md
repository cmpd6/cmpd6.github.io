 The heterogeneity of the host population plays a vital role in the transmission and outbreak of infectious diseases. The contact pattern among various individuals can be different based on their age. This work investigates an m-age heterogeneous epidemic model incorporating limited treatment facilities. The expression for the basic reproduction number and conditions for the
global stability of the system is derived. It is observed that the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable if $R_{0}\leq 1$ while an endemic equilibrium exists uniquely if $R_{0} &gt; 1$. The numerical simulation is demonstrated to illustrate the results.
