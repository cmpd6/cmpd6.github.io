The release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into the population of wild mosquitoes is one of the promising biological control methods for combating the population abundance of mosquitoes that cause deadly diseases, such as dengue. In this lecture, I will present a two-sex mathematical model for the population ecology of dengue mosquitoes and disease, and use the model to assess the potential impact of the periodic release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes (into the wild mosquito population in the community) on the population ecology of the dengue mosquitoes and disease.
