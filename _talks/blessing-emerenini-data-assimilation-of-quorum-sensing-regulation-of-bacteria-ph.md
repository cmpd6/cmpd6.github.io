Quorum Sensing is a cell-cell communication induced when an individual bacterium produces small diffusible molecules that can be detected by surrounding organisms. Pseudomonas species are gram-negative bacteria capable of forming a community called biofilm. Biofilms are difficult to eradicate, more especially when formed on living tissues. To facilitate the establishment of infection on its host, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an impressive array of virulence factors, several of which have been found to be regulated by quorum sensing. The use of phages in bacterial treatment has become a welcoming development over the years. In this study, we explore several modeling approaches, investigating possible contributing factors and parameters in understanding the role of quorum sensing in regulating bacteria-phage interactions in biofilm.
