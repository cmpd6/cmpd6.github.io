The cell cycle is critical to ensuring a cell functions and proliferates correctly, and is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In the blood system, cytokines help stimulate and inhibit blood cell production, ultimately determining cell fate. In this talk, I will discuss our recent studies incorporating delay differential equations to model the cell cycle with immunology-related applications, including immuno-oncology and immune responses to viral infections.
