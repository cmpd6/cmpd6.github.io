Inner Mongolia is a historically endemic area of brucellosis in China. With a series of the prevention and control measures including immunization and quarantine, the positive rate of sheep brucellosis in some regions still remains between 1%-2%. In this talk, I will present a modelling study based on the data from Xingan League to look at the transmission and control of brucellosis in both human and sheep. Using the model with the implementing process of vaccination program, in particularly incorporating the role and contribution of village animal epidemic prevention personnel of the animal health system, I will explain the threshold dynamics of the transmission and present an estimation of the minimum public health resources needed for the mitigation, control and eradication of this zoonosis in Xingan League. This is a joint work with Juan Zhang, Juan Li and collaboration with China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center.
