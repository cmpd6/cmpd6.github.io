Immunity is generated from infection and vaccination. Immunity can also decay over time, because of natural degradation, or because a pathogen evolves, lessening the protective effects of immunity in a host. We have developed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Fitting the models to in-host measures of the immune response and/or pathogen or vaccine load, we quantify the production and decay of the humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune response. Results are translated to the population level to quantify distributions of immunity by age. These models are used to help inform decision-makers in developing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical intervention programs. In this talk, we will review the in-host models of vaccination and infection, and we will quantify the distributions of immunity in a population over time. We will consider Ontario, Canada as a case study.
