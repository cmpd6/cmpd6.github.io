Nonlinear delay-differential equations with state-dependant delays occur naturally in a number of regulatory processes, including production and control of physiological populations. Some instances of the physiologically proper formulation of the state dependance in haematological systems will be presented, and a historical example (from MPD2) will be revisited.
