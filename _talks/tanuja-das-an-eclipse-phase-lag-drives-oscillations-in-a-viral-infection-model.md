We present a compartmental delay differential equation model of an in-host infection with density limited target cell growth and an eclipse phase. We establish, via a Lyapunov function, the basins of attraction of the two infection-free equilibria, and we study the delay-driven oscillations around the infection-present equilibrium. The model is a core component of many in-host models for infection and immunity. In particular, recent models for SARS-CoV-2.
