Heterogeneity in biological populations, from cancer to ecological systems, is ubiquitous. Despite this knowledge, current mathematical models in population biology often do not account for inter- or intra-individual heterogeneity. In systems such as cancer, this means assuming cellular homogeneity and deterministic phenotypes, despite the fact that heterogeneity is thought to play a crucial role in therapy resistance. In this talk, I will discuss several approaches I have developed towards incorporating and estimating cellular heterogeneity in partial differential equation (PDE) models of GBM growth. In particular, I will use random differential equations for modeling heterogeneity and the Prohorov metric framework for estimating parameter distributions from aggregate data. Although the phenotypic heterogeneity I examine in this talk is specifically directed towards growth and diffusion rates of cells, the framework is broadly applicable to any model parameters, including those relevant to the tumor microenvironment.
