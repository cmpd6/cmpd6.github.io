Vaccination policy for Dengue (DENV) has been a hotly debated topic. Recently developed vaccines have been linked to increased risk of severe infection in naive individuals, leading some scientists to advise only vaccination of previously infected individuals or to not deploy any vaccine, whereas other experts have downplayed the risk or suggested the benefits of population-wide vaccination outweigh the risks. Furthermore, researchers have called for more refined antibody screening of the target population since pre-existent antibody level modulates infection severity risk. In this study, we formulate an antibody size-structured multi-scale epi- demic PDE DENV model that is linked to a coupled immunological ODE virus-immune response system. In the model formulation, we consider: (i) waning immunity and immune boosting processes induced by sequential infections via multiple co-circulating DENV strains, (ii) reinfection and vaccination of susceptible and recovered individuals, and (iii) individual and population scale evolving immunity. Via threshold analysis, we derive the strain specific basic reproduction number and invasion numbers along with the equilibria and their stability conditions. Later, via numerical simulations, we show how the bidirectional feedback between immunological scale viral immune kinetics and population scale virus transmission with evolving immunity on both scales can affect population level disease severity and abundance. In particular, we address the question: how can vaccination be employed to eradicate the disease, while avoiding possible severe infection in vaccinated individuals, all at a feasible economic cost?
