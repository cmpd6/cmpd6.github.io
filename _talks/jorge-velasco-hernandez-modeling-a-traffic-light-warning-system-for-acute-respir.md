Balanced enforcement and relaxation of measures guided through a traffic-light system that considers public risk perception and economic costs may improve the public health benefit of the policies while reducing their cost. We derive a model for the epidemiological traffic-light policies based on the best response for trigger measures driven by the risk perception of people, instant reproduction number, and the prevalence of a hypothetical acute respiratory infection. With numerical experiments, we evaluate and identify the role of appreciation from a hypothetical controller that could opt for protocols aligned with the cost due to the burden of the underlying disease and the economic cost of implementing measures.
