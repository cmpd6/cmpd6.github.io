Identifiability, estimability, and parameter reduction methods provide tools to understand the interactions between parameters, model structure, and outputs—and how these interactions determine what inferences and predictions are possible for a given system. In particular, issues of identifiability and uncertainty can affect whether it is possible to select an optimal intervention—an important question for applied infectious disease and biological modeling.  In this talk, we will explore how identifiability can be used in practice to help inform epidemiological decision-making, and when intervention strategies are or are not robust to uncertainty in the model parameters and structure.
