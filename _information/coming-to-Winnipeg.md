[Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg) is the capital of the Province of [Manitoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba), in central Canada and is home to close to 800,000 people. So, while not a major entry point into Canada, it is relatively easy to access from major North American hubs.

From Canada, there are frequent direct flights from all major points of entry, through both major Canadian airlines (Air Canada and Westjet):
- Toronto
- Montr√©al
- Vancouver
- Calgary

From the USA:
- Chicago (United)
- Minneapolis-Saint Paul (Delta)

Rail access is also possible with [Via Rail](https://www.viarail.ca/en) if you are so inclined, but will also involve long trips: it takes one day and a half from Toronto and over two days from Vancouver. Canada is a vast country, so unless you are driving from Saskatchewan, North Dakota, Minnesota or Northeastern Ontario, distances are prohibitive.
