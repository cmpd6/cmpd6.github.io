[Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg) is the capital of the Province of [Manitoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba), in central Canada and is home to close to 800,000 people.

Things to do in Winnipeg (some ideas):
- [Canadian Museum for Human Rights](https://humanrights.ca/), the only Canadian national museum outside of the Ottawa region, has the aim to "explore the subject of human rights with a special but not exclusive reference to Canada, to enhance the public's understanding of human rights, to promote respect for others and to encourage reflection and dialogue."
- [The Forks](https://www.theforks.com/) is located at the junction of the [Assiniboine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assiniboine_River) and [Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_of_the_North) Rivers.
- The [Winnipeg Art Gallery](https://www.wag.ca/) is home in particular to [Qaumajuq](https://www.wag.ca/about/qaumajuq/).
- Old Saint Boniface, the main French-speaking area in Winnipeg. Saint Boniface is also home to the [Université de Saint-Boniface](https://ustboniface.ca/), the oldest (1818) French-speaking university outside of Québec, as well as to an [interesting cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Boniface_Cathedral), the grounds of which house the tomb of [Louis Riel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Riel).
