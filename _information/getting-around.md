The conference will be held on the [Fort Garry](https://umanitoba.ca/about-um/our-campuses) (main) Campus of the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/), located in the south end of the city. Accomodation can be found on campus, in hotels near the campus or downtown. 

Fast direct bus service is available from downtown to the Fort Garry Campus using the [Blue Rapid Transit Line](https://info.winnipegtransit.com/en/service/blue-rapid-transit/). Be careful to take a *University of Manitoba* destined bus, not one headed to *Saint Norbert*. 
Other bus lines connecting downtown to the campus are the 47 and the 60 lines.

Please note that the first day of the conference, Monday 22 May, is Victoria Day, a holiday in the Province of Manitoba. Buses will circulate on a Sunday schedule that day, so with reduced frequency. If you are staying in a downtown hotel, please plan accordingly.
