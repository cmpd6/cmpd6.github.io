We offer some support for students and early career researchers. Information is available [here](https://cmpd6.github.io/information/travel-awards/). You could also consider travel funding from [SMB](https://www.smb.org/travel-grants/) or (for US-based researchers) [AMS](https://www.ams.org/programs/travel-grants/AMS-SimonsTG).

Thanks to additional funding from the University of Manitoba, we can offer a greatly reduced rate ($50) for some UM students and postdocs. This will be an option on the registration page, please use your UM email to register. Note that this will be offered on a first-come, first-served basis, so register early if you plan to use this award.
