## Finding the conference site within campus

All conference lectures and events will be held at [St John's College](https://umanitoba.ca/st-johns-college/) ([Google Map link](https://goo.gl/maps/11WF5JJ3zfo5Qxqv5)). The entrance on Ralph Campbell Road is very close to the Schultz Theatre, where all plenary lectures and one session will always take place and in the lobby of which coffee breaks will be held.

To go from the bus stop where all buses unload to the Schultz Theatre, you could for instance [follow this path](https://goo.gl/maps/umC4NnLS8schi4tH9).

To leave campus by bus, you will need to pick a stop. For instance, there are 3 buses going directly downtown: Blue, 47 and 60. The Blue has a [dedicated stop](https://winnipegtransit.com/stops/60675/?filterVariants=BLUE-1-D), while the 47 and 60 are at [another stop](https://winnipegtransit.com/stops/60674/?filterVariants=36-1-C,36-1-M,47-0-R,47-0-K,60-1-D). There are two or three additional stops serving other lines. All stops are close to one another.

## Beware the geese!

The UM campus is currently home to nesting Canada geese and it is possible that some will still be nesting or nursing during the conference. For their and *your* safety, it is wise to give them some space. Normally, campus services [alert to the presence of geese](https://news.umanitoba.ca/geese-whos-back/), but since geese tend to wander around..

## Getting to campus

The conference will be held on the [Fort Garry](https://umanitoba.ca/about-um/our-campuses) (main) Campus of the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/), located in the south end of the city. 

Fast direct bus service is available from downtown to the Fort Garry Campus using the [Blue Rapid Transit Line](https://info.winnipegtransit.com/en/service/blue-rapid-transit/). Be careful to take a *University of Manitoba* destined bus, not one headed to *Saint Norbert*. 
Other bus lines connecting downtown to the campus are the 47 and the 60 lines.
Bus lines also allow access to areas closer to the campus.
