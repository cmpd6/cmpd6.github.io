Room 118 is a mid-sized (120 seats) amphitheatre on the same floor and a few metres down the hall from the Schultz Theatre. Room 118 has a large video projector, a desktop Windows PC that will be available to participants, VGA, HDMI and USB-C connectors. It also has Apple AirPlay, although no organiser has ever used this system so we may not be able to provide full help.
