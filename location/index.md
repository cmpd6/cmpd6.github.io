CMPD6 will be held in Winnipeg. [Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg) is the capital of the Province of [Manitoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba), in central Canada. Winnipeg is home to close to 800,000 people.

The conference will be held on the Fort Garry (main) Campus of the University of Manitoba, located in the south end of the city. Accomodation can be found on campus, in hotels near the campus or downtown. (Regular fast bus service is available from downtown to the Fort Garry Campus using the [Blue Rapid Transit Line](https://info.winnipegtransit.com/en/service/blue-rapid-transit/). Be careful to take a University of Manitoba destined bus, not one headed to Saint Norbert.)

You can adapt the design as well as the section shown on the map by copying the `assets/js/main.js` from the theme's repository and editing it. See also the subsection [Location / Room Overview](https://github.com/DigitaleGesellschaft/jekyll-theme-conference/#location--room-overview) section of the theme's README file.
