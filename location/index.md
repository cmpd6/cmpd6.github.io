CMPD6 will be held in Winnipeg. [Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg) is the capital of the Province of [Manitoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba), in central Canada and is home to close to 800,000 people. Access to Winnipeg from the USA is easy through Chicago (United) or Minneapolis (Delta). From the rest of the world, connection is either through the USA or through major Canadian airports (Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver or Calgary). Winnipeg is served by the two major Canadian airlines: Air Canada and Westjet.

The conference will be held on the [Fort Garry](https://umanitoba.ca/about-um/our-campuses) (main) Campus of the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/), located in the south end of the city. Accomodation can be found on campus, in hotels near the campus or downtown. (Fast direct bus service is available from downtown to the Fort Garry Campus using the [Blue Rapid Transit Line](https://info.winnipegtransit.com/en/service/blue-rapid-transit/). Be careful to take a University of Manitoba destined bus, not one headed to Saint Norbert.)

Things to do in Winnipeg (some ideas):
- [Canadian Museum for Human Rights](https://humanrights.ca/), the only Canadian national museum outside of the Ottawa region, has the aim to "explore the subject of human rights with a special but not exclusive reference to Canada, to enhance the public's understanding of human rights, to promote respect for others and to encourage reflection and dialogue."
- [The Forks](https://www.theforks.com/) is located at the junction of the [Assiniboine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assiniboine_River) and [Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_of_the_North) Rivers.
- [Manitoba Museum](https://manitobamuseum.ca/).
- The [Winnipeg Art Gallery](https://www.wag.ca/) is home in particular to [Qaumajuq](https://www.wag.ca/about/qaumajuq/).
- Old Saint Boniface, the main French-speaking area in Winnipeg. Saint Boniface is also home to the [Université de Saint-Boniface](https://ustboniface.ca/), the oldest (1818) French-speaking university outside of Québec, as well as to an [interesting cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Boniface_Cathedral), the grounds of which house the tomb of [Louis Riel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Riel).
- The Exchange District

Outside of Winnipeg:
- [Lake Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Winnipeg), should be thawed by mid-May. Eleventh largest freshwater lake in the world, its southern end is 60 kilometres north of Winnipeg.
