CMPD6 will be held in Winnipeg. [Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg) is the capital of the Province of [Manitoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba), in central Canada and is home to close to 800,000 people.

The conference will be held on the [Fort Garry](https://umanitoba.ca/about-um/our-campuses) (main) Campus of the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/), located in the south end of the city. Accomodation can be found on campus, in hotels near the campus or downtown. (Fast direct bus service is available from downtown to the Fort Garry Campus using the [Blue Rapid Transit Line](https://info.winnipegtransit.com/en/service/blue-rapid-transit/). Be careful to take a University of Manitoba destined bus, not one headed to Saint Norbert.)

Things to do in Winnipeg (some ideas):
- Canadian Museum for Human Rights
- The Forks
- Manitoba Museum

Outside of Winnipeg:
- [Lake Winnipeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Winnipeg), should be thawed by mid-May. Starts 60 kilometres north of Winnipeg.
