## Combining data from surveillance on mosquitoes and corvids to understand the factors affecting the dynamics of West Nile Virus in Emilia-Romagna, Italy

West Nile Virus (WNV) is now endemic in Northern Italy (as well as in many European countries), with a yearly number of recorded human cases oscillating between few tens up to around 600 in 2018 and 2022. Humans actually are dead-end hosts, while the infection is transmitted between Culex mosquitoes and several species of birds. 
 The region Emilia-Romagna (one of the most affected areas) has in place since 2013 an extended surveillance program of both mosquitoes and corvids. We have analysed these data through an SEI-SEIR model where several parameters depend on temperature, as shown in laboratory experiments, while over-wintering occurs through infected diapausing mosquitoes.
 We found that an essential factor determining human risk is spring temperature, as confirmed also by a statistical analysis of European data. Another important factor for epidemic dynamics in a given year is pre-existing immunity in birds; as no serological data exist, we reconstructed the trend of seroprevalence over the years, which however has no clear relation with epidemic intensities.
