## The interplay between dispersal and Allee effects in discrete-time population models

We develop discrete-time models that describe population dynamics with dispersal between different patch locations. We first present a simple two-patch model for an unstructured population where all individuals are assumed identical, and then extend it to a multi-patch stage-structured model where individuals are distinguished by different developmental stages in their lifecycle. We analyze the dynamics of the two models under a nonlinear fecundity term that exhibits an Allee effect. We show that these systems have rich dynamics including both monostable and bistable dynamics.
