## Modelling the impact of multiple transmission pathways on disease severity of Coronavirus

Coronaviruses are a pervasive group of pathogens for which transmission through the contaminated surface is a concern. The transmission of the virus occurs primarily through person-person contact, with contaminated surfaces providing a secondary transmission route. In this work, a modified SEIR epidemic model incorporating shedding effect is proposed to analyze transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 virus among different individuals' classes. The basic reproduction number ($R_{0}$) is calculated using the next-generation matrix method, taking shedding as a new infection. The bifurcation theory and central manifold theorem are employed to exhibit the conditions for backward bifurcation at $R_{0}=1$. The numerical simulation is demonstrated to illustrate the results, showing that an increase in person-contaminated surface-person transmission parameter leads the system to endemicity.
