Designing control strategies for managing SARS-CoV-2 infections requires multiscale investigation of heterogeneity in virus transmission, population susceptibility, and disease outcomes. In this talk, I will investigate the role of individual infections in transmission as well as the role of immune responses in disease outcomes. The models will be used to suggest testing-vaccination combinations needed for limiting an outbreak and provide explanations for immune mechanisms resulting in severe disease.
