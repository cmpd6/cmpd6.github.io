We propose an integrated model for West Nile virus disease spread inclusive of mosquito, bird and human populations. The populations are structured by infection-age and, other than mosquitos (for whom we assume infection has no recovery), partitioned into susceptible, infected, and recovered. We prove the well-posedness of the system and identify parameters from real-life data in order to perform scenario analysis of how transmission may change due to different weather looming in the era of climate change.
