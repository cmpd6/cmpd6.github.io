I am presenting as part of a minisymposium,-	Modelling the Cancer Microenvironment,MONDAL HASAN,ZAHID,mondalhasanzahid@ufl.edu,,University of Florida,,The biting rate of Aedes aegypti and its variability: A systematic review (1970 - 2022),"Background

Transmission models have a long history in the study of mosquito-borne disease dynamics. The mosquito biting rate (MBR) is an important parameter in these models, however, estimating its value empirically is complex. Modeling studies obtain biting rate values from various types of studies, each of them having its strengths and limitations. Thus, understanding these study designs and the factors that contribute to MBR estimates and their variability is an important step towards standardizing these estimates. We do this for an important arbovirus vector Aedes aegypti. 

Methodology/Principal Findings

We perform a systematic review using search terms such as ‘biting rate’ and ‘biting frequency’ combined with ‘Aedes aegypti’ (‘Ae. aegypti’ or ‘A. aegypti’). We screened 3,201 articles from PubMed and ProQuest databases, of which 21 met our inclusion criteria. Two broader types of studies are identified: human landing catch (HLC) studies and multiple feeding studies. We analyze the biting data provided as well as the methodologies used in these studies to characterize the variability of these estimates across temporal, spatial, and environmental factors and to identify the strengths and limitations of existing methodologies. Based on these analyses, we present two approaches to estimate population mean per mosquito biting rate: one that combines studies estimating the number of bites taken per gonotrophic cycle and the gonotrophic cycle duration, and a second that uses data from histological studies. Based on one histological study dataset, we estimate biting rates of Ae. aegypti (0.60 and 0.56 bite/mosquito-day in Thailand and Puerto Rico, respectively). 

Conclusions/Significance

Our review reinforces the importance of engaging with vector biology when using mosquito biting data in transmission modeling studies. For Ae. aegypti, this includes understanding the variation of the gonotrophic cycle duration and the number of bites per gonotrophic cycle, as well as recognizing the potential for spatial and temporal variability. To address these variabilities, we advocate for site-specific data and the development of a standardized approach to estimate the biting rate.

The contact pattern among various individuals can be different based on their age. This work investigates an m-age heterogeneous epidemic model incorporating limited treatment facilities. The expression for the basic reproduction number and conditions for the
global stability of the system is derived. It is observed that the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable if $R_{0}\leq 1$ while an endemic equilibrium exists uniquely if $R_{0} &gt; 1$. The numerical simulation is demonstrated to illustrate the results.",,,,

People living with HIV (PLWH) older than age 55 have an enhanced risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is further unclear whether multiple standard doses of COVID-19 vaccines elicit a durable immunity in this population or whether the vaccines can destabilize HIV reservoirs. In this talk I will discuss our unpublished work where we followed n = 91 PLWH aged 55+ and n = 23 age-matched HIV- individuals over a period of 48 weeks following COVID-19 dose one, capturing longitudinal immunological outcomes from two subsequent booster doses.  I will introduce the longitudinal immunological findings for IgG, memory-B cells, and cytokines (IFNg and IL2). I will then motivate our novel within-host immunological model which couples these quantities together, and the findings of our fits to determine dose-dependent decay rates and half life values.  Model fit findings, practical identifiability concerns, and biological implications of the within-host modelling approach will be discussed. ",accept,accept,,x

Exosomal miRNAs of breast cancer are known to enter the bone and degrade it, which facilitates cancer cells invasion into the bone interior and ensures its successful colonization. In this paper we use a mathematical
model to first describe, in health, the continuous remodeling of the bone by bone forming osteoblasts, bone resorbing osteoclasts, and the RANKL-OPG-RANK signaling system, which
keeps the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. We next demonstrate how breast cancer exosomal miRNAs disrupt this balance, either by increasing or by decreasing the ratio of osteoclasts/osteoblasts, which results in abnormal high bone resorption or abnormal high bone forming, respectively, and in bone weakening in both cases. Finally we consider the case of
abnormally high resorption and evaluate the effect of drugs, which may increase bone density to normal level, thus protecting the bone from invasion by cancer cells.",,,,

The causes behind the initiation, progression, and ultimate resistance of this cancer is unknown, though it is recognized that two cellular phenotypes underpin its deadliness: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES). How these phenotypes influence the eco-evolutionary dynamics of neuroblastoma cell populations (especially under therapy) remains a mystery. This is due to the confusion surrounding whether the ADRN and MES phenotypes represent different cell types (species) or cell states (stages in the life cycle of a single species). This distinction is critical in understanding and ultimately treating neuroblastoma. In this talk, we will introduce theoretical methods to model the eco-evolutionary dynamics in state-structured neuroblastoma populations and use these models to tease apart cell type vs. cell state hypotheses. We will then expand and generalize this framework to continuous-structured models and discuss implications for cancer and bacterial resistance more generally.",accept,accept,,x
Contributed Talk,,Toshiyuki,Namba,tnamba@omu.ac.jp,,Osaka Metropolitan University,Faculty,Unexpected coexistence and extinction in an intraguild predation system,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is predation on consumers (IGprey) by predators (IGpredator) that exploit common resources with the consumers.Since the consumer is preyed upon by the predator, a necessary condition for the coexistence of the consumer and predator is supposed that the consumer is superior in resource competition to the predator. Classical mathematical models have predicted that the consumer and predator exclude the others in environments with low and high productivity, respectively, and that they can coexist only in environments with intermediate productivity. However, empirical results show that consumers persist in highly productive environments. Thus, the prevalence of intraguild predation in fertile environments has long been puzzling to the ecologist.

At the CMPD5, We showed that the quality of the resource and consumer as diets to the predator is the essential parameter to determine the dynamics of the IGP system and verified that the consumer never becomes extinct when it is not beneficial to the predator. Furthermore, not the consumer but the predator may become extinct when the consumer is not profitable for the predator. In this presentation, we challenge the supposed necessary condition for coexistence, that consumers must be superior in resource competition. We will show that large amplitude oscillations in the resource-predator system allow the consumer to increase and coexist with predators even if the former is inferior in resource competition Furthermore, if the resource-consumer system is oscillatory, the predator is forced
to become extinct when environmental productivity is high. Therefore, the fates of the consumer and predator in the oscillatory systems are very different from those in the stationary systems. To fully understand the intraguild predation system, it is necessary to examine nonlinear dynamics in detail.

virus. The earlier developed drugs, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) analogues, have been shown to be effective in suppressing HBV viral load (VL) in patients with chronic infection. However, these drugs need to be taken for a lifetime to maintain VL suppression, creating the risk of adverse effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of the virus. The development of a new class of drugs, the capsid protein allosteric modulators (CpAMs), has created renewed hope for finding a functional cure for HBV. These drugs inhibit the encapsidation of polymerase-pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) in infected cells. We developed a multiscale age-structured model of HBV. Our model incorporates the intracellular and extracellular dynamics of HBV RNA and DNA and keeps track of the age of infection of infected hepatocytes. We derived an equivalent ODE system for our multiscale model and fitted the reduced model to the viral loads of chronic HBV patients treated with CpAMs and NTRIs, to understand the efficacies of the drugs.",,,,

Moreover, durable viral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 generated after infection in naïve hosts or after vaccination is of high importance, given its implication for protection from severe disease. To better understand the formation and function of cellular immunological memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a mechanistic, computational model of COVID-19 immunopathology that explicitly describes the interactions between epithelial cells, innate and adaptive immune cells, and cytokines, as well as the differentiation process of naïve CD8+ T cells into effector and memory cell subsets. Through calibration and validation against a broad range of experimental and clinical immunological data, we studied heterogeneity in CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Using our model, we identified key mechanisms distinguishing COVID-19 severity and reducing inflammation in reinfections using a virtual patient cohort. These include the monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation rate, the IFN production rate by infected cells, and the monocyte recruitment rate. Our results show that memory CD8+ T cell generation is critical to offering durable protection against severe COVID-19 and reduces heterogeneous outcomes upon re-exposure to the same virus. We can also apply our model to predict the humoral immune response post-vaccination to study breakthrough infections. Thus, this work provides a platform for investigating key questions about heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2.",,,,

By integrating the age structure and interregional migration, this model allows us to evaluate the impact of interregional migration on the population growth rate. 
 We have found a theorem that expresses the eigensystem of the multiregional Leslie matrix using eigenvalues and matrix elements. Using this theorem, we can estimate the contribution of each region to the descendants and the percentage of ancestors in each region in a steady state.
  For example, in Japan, which has been in a phase of population decline since 2010, there is not only a declining birthrate and an aging population but also a problem of uneven population movement due to the concentration of the population in Tokyo. A sensitivity analysis based on our analysis results and the national census can clarify the mathematical structure of population decline. In this study, we apply our theory to Japanese governmental statistics from 2010 to 2020 to numerically evaluate the impact of age-specific and regional migration and fertility rates on population decline.

The transmission of the virus occurs primarily through person-person contact, with contaminated surfaces providing a secondary transmission route. In this work, a modified SEIR epidemic model incorporating shedding effect is proposed to analyze transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 virus among different individuals' classes. The basic reproduction number ($R_{0}$) is calculated using the next-generation matrix method, taking shedding as a new infection. The bifurcation theory and central manifold theorem are employed to exhibit the conditions for backward bifurcation at $R_{0}=1$. The numerical simulation is demonstrated to illustrate the results, showing that an increase in person-contaminated surface-person transmission parameter leads the system to endemicity.",accept,accept,,x

The local stability conditions of all the fixed points in the system are determined. Here, codim-1 and codim-2 bifurcation, including multiple and generic bifurcations in the discrete model, are explored. The model undergoes fold bifurcation, flip bifurcation, Neimark-Sacker bifurcation and resonances bi-
furcation of codimension two at different fixed points. Using critical normal form theorem and bifurcation theory, this study obtains the normal form coefficients to confirm the nondegeneracy of codim-1 and codim-2 bifurcations in the model. The numerical simulation gives a wide range of periodic cycles and bifurcation in the system. In the system, NSB signifies that both species can fluctuate near critical parameter values and stable fluctuations seem. The resonance bifurcation in the discrete-time map indicates that both species coincide till order 4 in stable periodic cycles near some critical parametric
values.",accept,accept,,x
