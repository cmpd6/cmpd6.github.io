Transmission models have a long history in the study of mosquito-borne disease dynamics. The mosquito biting rate (MBR) is an important parameter in these models, however, estimating its value empirically is complex. Modeling studies obtain biting rate values from various types of studies, each of them having its strengths and limitations. Thus, understanding these study designs and the factors that contribute to MBR estimates and their variability is an important step towards standardizing these estimates. We do this for an important arbovirus vector Aedes aegypti. 

Methodology/Principal Findings

We perform a systematic review using search terms such as ‘biting rate’ and ‘biting frequency’ combined with ‘Aedes aegypti’ (‘Ae. aegypti’ or ‘A. aegypti’). We screened 3,201 articles from PubMed and ProQuest databases, of which 21 met our inclusion criteria. Two broader types of studies are identified: human landing catch (HLC) studies and multiple feeding studies. We analyze the biting data provided as well as the methodologies used in these studies to characterize the variability of these estimates across temporal, spatial, and environmental factors and to identify the strengths and limitations of existing methodologies. Based on these analyses, we present two approaches to estimate population mean per mosquito biting rate: one that combines studies estimating the number of bites taken per gonotrophic cycle and the gonotrophic cycle duration, and a second that uses data from histological studies. Based on one histological study dataset, we estimate biting rates of Ae. aegypti (0.60 and 0.56 bite/mosquito-day in Thailand and Puerto Rico, respectively). 

Conclusions/Significance

Our review reinforces the importance of engaging with vector biology when using mosquito biting data in transmission modeling studies. For Ae. aegypti, this includes understanding the variation of the gonotrophic cycle duration and the number of bites per gonotrophic cycle, as well as recognizing the potential for spatial and temporal variability. To address these variabilities, we advocate for site-specific data and the development of a standardized approach to estimate the biting rate.

People living with HIV (PLWH) older than age 55 have an enhanced risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is further unclear whether multiple standard doses of COVID-19 vaccines elicit a durable immunity in this population or whether the vaccines can destabilize HIV reservoirs. In this talk I will discuss our unpublished work where we followed n = 91 PLWH aged 55+ and n = 23 age-matched HIV- individuals over a period of 48 weeks following COVID-19 dose one, capturing longitudinal immunological outcomes from two subsequent booster doses.  I will introduce the longitudinal immunological findings for IgG, memory-B cells, and cytokines (IFNg and IL2). I will then motivate our novel within-host immunological model which couples these quantities together, and the findings of our fits to determine dose-dependent decay rates and half life values.  Model fit findings, practical identifiability concerns, and biological implications of the within-host modelling approach will be discussed. ",Feb 21st,accept,accept,,sent Feb 24th

Exosomal miRNAs of breast cancer are known to enter the bone and degrade it, which facilitates cancer cells invasion into the bone interior and ensures its successful colonization. In this paper we use a mathematical
model to first describe, in health, the continuous remodeling of the bone by bone forming osteoblasts, bone resorbing osteoclasts, and the RANKL-OPG-RANK signaling system, which
keeps the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. We next demonstrate how breast cancer exosomal miRNAs disrupt this balance, either by increasing or by decreasing the ratio of osteoclasts/osteoblasts, which results in abnormal high bone resorption or abnormal high bone forming, respectively, and in bone weakening in both cases. Finally we consider the case of
abnormally high resorption and evaluate the effect of drugs, which may increase bone density to normal level, thus protecting the bone from invasion by cancer cells.",Feb 21st,,,,

The causes behind the initiation, progression, and ultimate resistance of this cancer is unknown, though it is recognized that two cellular phenotypes underpin its deadliness: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES). How these phenotypes influence the eco-evolutionary dynamics of neuroblastoma cell populations (especially under therapy) remains a mystery. This is due to the confusion surrounding whether the ADRN and MES phenotypes represent different cell types (species) or cell states (stages in the life cycle of a single species). This distinction is critical in understanding and ultimately treating neuroblastoma. In this talk, we will introduce theoretical methods to model the eco-evolutionary dynamics in state-structured neuroblastoma populations and use these models to tease apart cell type vs. cell state hypotheses. We will then expand and generalize this framework to continuous-structured models and discuss implications for cancer and bacterial resistance more generally.",Feb 21st,accept,accept,,sent Feb 24th 
Contributed Talk,,Toshiyuki,Namba,tnamba@omu.ac.jp,,Osaka Metropolitan University,Faculty,Unexpected coexistence and extinction in an intraguild predation system,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is predation on consumers (IGprey) by predators (IGpredator) that exploit common resources with the consumers.Since the consumer is preyed upon by the predator, a necessary condition for the coexistence of the consumer and predator is supposed that the consumer is superior in resource competition to the predator. Classical mathematical models have predicted that the consumer and predator exclude the others in environments with low and high productivity, respectively, and that they can coexist only in environments with intermediate productivity. However, empirical results show that consumers persist in highly productive environments. Thus, the prevalence of intraguild predation in fertile environments has long been puzzling to the ecologist.

At the CMPD5, We showed that the quality of the resource and consumer as diets to the predator is the essential parameter to determine the dynamics of the IGP system and verified that the consumer never becomes extinct when it is not beneficial to the predator. Furthermore, not the consumer but the predator may become extinct when the consumer is not profitable for the predator. In this presentation, we challenge the supposed necessary condition for coexistence, that consumers must be superior in resource competition. We will show that large amplitude oscillations in the resource-predator system allow the consumer to increase and coexist with predators even if the former is inferior in resource competition Furthermore, if the resource-consumer system is oscillatory, the predator is forced
to become extinct when environmental productivity is high. Therefore, the fates of the consumer and predator in the oscillatory systems are very different from those in the stationary systems. To fully understand the intraguild predation system, it is necessary to examine nonlinear dynamics in detail.

virus. The earlier developed drugs, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) analogues, have been shown to be effective in suppressing HBV viral load (VL) in patients with chronic infection. However, these drugs need to be taken for a lifetime to maintain VL suppression, creating the risk of adverse effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of the virus. The development of a new class of drugs, the capsid protein allosteric modulators (CpAMs), has created renewed hope for finding a functional cure for HBV. These drugs inhibit the encapsidation of polymerase-pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) in infected cells. We developed a multiscale age-structured model of HBV. Our model incorporates the intracellular and extracellular dynamics of HBV RNA and DNA and keeps track of the age of infection of infected hepatocytes. We derived an equivalent ODE system for our multiscale model and fitted the reduced model to the viral loads of chronic HBV patients treated with CpAMs and NTRIs, to understand the efficacies of the drugs.",Feb 21st,,,,

Moreover, durable viral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 generated after infection in naïve hosts or after vaccination is of high importance, given its implication for protection from severe disease. To better understand the formation and function of cellular immunological memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a mechanistic, computational model of COVID-19 immunopathology that explicitly describes the interactions between epithelial cells, innate and adaptive immune cells, and cytokines, as well as the differentiation process of naïve CD8+ T cells into effector and memory cell subsets. Through calibration and validation against a broad range of experimental and clinical immunological data, we studied heterogeneity in CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Using our model, we identified key mechanisms distinguishing COVID-19 severity and reducing inflammation in reinfections using a virtual patient cohort. These include the monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation rate, the IFN production rate by infected cells, and the monocyte recruitment rate. Our results show that memory CD8+ T cell generation is critical to offering durable protection against severe COVID-19 and reduces heterogeneous outcomes upon re-exposure to the same virus. We can also apply our model to predict the humoral immune response post-vaccination to study breakthrough infections. Thus, this work provides a platform for investigating key questions about heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2.",Feb 21st,,,,

By integrating the age structure and interregional migration, this model allows us to evaluate the impact of interregional migration on the population growth rate. 
 We have found a theorem that expresses the eigensystem of the multiregional Leslie matrix using eigenvalues and matrix elements. Using this theorem, we can estimate the contribution of each region to the descendants and the percentage of ancestors in each region in a steady state.
  For example, in Japan, which has been in a phase of population decline since 2010, there is not only a declining birthrate and an aging population but also a problem of uneven population movement due to the concentration of the population in Tokyo. A sensitivity analysis based on our analysis results and the national census can clarify the mathematical structure of population decline. In this study, we apply our theory to Japanese governmental statistics from 2010 to 2020 to numerically evaluate the impact of age-specific and regional migration and fertility rates on population decline.

In this work, a modified SEIR epidemic model incorporating shedding effect is proposed to analyze transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 virus among different individuals' classes. The basic reproduction number ($R_{0}$) is calculated using the next-generation matrix method, taking shedding as a new infection. The bifurcation theory and central manifold theorem are employed to exhibit the conditions for backward bifurcation at $R_{0}=1$.

Contributed Talk,,Ranjini,Bhattacharya,ranjini.bhattacharya@moffitt.org,,Moffitt Cancer Center,Graduate PhD,Angiogenesis in Cancer: A Tragedy of Commons,"Cancer is the result of evolution within the tumor microenvironment. Natural selection selects for cells capable of efficient nutrient uptake. Cancer cells achieve this by overexpressing angiogenic factors (VEGF) that induce the formation of blood vessels that carry nutrients to the tumor. Traditionally, angiogenesis has been viewed as a cooperative phenomenon resulting in the evolution of free-loaders. Using a game theoretic framework, we model VEGF production as an evolutionary strategy and show that the over-production of VEGF is the result of a tragedy of commons.
 
 A cell’s investment in VEGF depends on the degree to which it aids its nutrient uptake. If higher production of VEGF leads to higher nutrient uptake, then cells are incentivized to produce VEGF. If nutrients are equally divided within a given neighborhood, an individual cell’s incentive to produce VEGF decreases. Our simulations predict that cancer cells produce 100 times more VEGF than typically seen in normal cells, and what would be their collective team optimum. This means that VEGF production by a cancer cell aims to co-opt nutrients from neighboring cells resulting in an evolutionary arms race. Increasing the number of cancer cells in a fixed neighborhood results in lower per-cell VEGF production while exacerbating the tragedy of the commons collectively. Next, we simulate anti-angiogenesis therapy and find that in response to therapy, cells adopt a low VEGF production strategy that continues to sustain growth in the cancer population. This results in evolutionary rescue. These results are in line with clinical observations. Our model challenges the existing paradigm of angiogenesis as a cooperative activity and provides novel insights into therapy in a clinical setting.",March 1st,accept,accept,,Send March 3

Although the number of reported cases and deaths in sub-Saharan Africa has been relatively low compared to other regions, it is unclear how much of this is due to low testing rates and reporting capacity. Moreover, the region's high prevalence of infectious diseases and malnutrition may weaken the immune system and increase the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Despite these challenges, it appears that individuals in sub-Saharan Africa have mounted robust immune responses to the virus, suggesting that factors such as prior exposure to similar viruses and genetic differences may have played a role in priming their immune response to COVID-19. Immune response priming, the process by which the immune system is prepared to respond to a future infection, can occur through various mechanisms, including natural infection or vaccination.

Recently, a particular attention has been paid to reinfection models in epidemiology. To cite a few, threshold conditions for infection, reinfection and endemicity of various SIRS models are studied in [Gomes and al. 2004], global stability of SEIRS model in [Li and Muldowney 1999], bifurcation analysis for a SIRI model presenting different contact rates for infection and reinfection in [Pagliara and al., 2018], and models counting reinfections in [Katriel, 2011], [Fang and Bliman, 2022]. Nevertheless, in most studies on reinfection, the infection and reinfection processes are assumed to behave essentially in the same way, which is quite limitative.
 
 With the aim of understanding the effects induced by differences between the stage of primo-infection and further reinfections,
 we introduce here an 8-dimensional two-stage SEIRS reinfection model in which the parameters characteristic of the disease dynamics are different for the primo-infection and for the following reinfections.
 The value of the basic reproduction number R0 of the model around the (unique) disease-free equilibrium
 is first derived, and the existence of up to two and three endemic equilibria, respectively in the cases R0 &lt;= 1 and R0&gt;1, is theoretically established under appropriate conditions on the system parameters.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute,Graduate PhD,Black Holes in TIME: the Effect of GRID Radiation on the Tumor-Immune Micro-environment,"Tumor-immune interactions shape a developing tumor and its tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) resulting in either well infiltrated, immunologically inflamed ‘hot’ tumor beds, or ‘cold’ immune deserts with low levels of infiltration that are suppressive in nature. The pre-treatment immune state of the TIME is associated with treatment outcome; immunologically hot tumors generally exhibit better responses to radio- and immunotherapy than cold tumors. However, radiotherapy is known to induce paradoxical immunological consequences, resulting in both immunostimulatory and inhibitory responses. In fact, it is thought that the radiation-induced tumoricidal immune response is curtailed by subsequent applications of radiation. It is thus conceivable that spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT), administered through GRID blocks to create areas of low or high dose exposure, may protect regions of the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby preserving anti-tumor immune responses. We use an agent-based model of tumor-immune interaction to investigate the therapeutic utility of SFRT. We evaluate the immunological consequences of various GRID architectures, radiation doses and dose scheduling, to identify which GRID architectures result in superior immune infiltration for each pre-treatment immune state. Additionally, we investigate TIMEs for which SFRT may be better suited, in an immune context, than conventional radiotherapy.",March 1st,,,,

 Fungal diseases cause serious damages in crop worldwide. In particular, coffee leaf rust (CLR), caused by fungus Hemileia vastatrix attacks coffee leaves and reduces coffee yield.
 Its control mainly relies on cultural practices, fungicides, resistant cultivars and biocontrol using hyperparasites. Fungicides are widely used, but have harmful ecological impact an
 important costs; the other methods need careful analysis for their deployment to be successful on the long term.
 This work presents a multi-seasonal model of the CLR development in the coffee plantation with continuous dynamics during the rainy season and a discrete event to represent
 the simpler dynamics during the dry season. Biological control using predators through one or more discrete introduction events over the year is then added. Analytical and semi-numerical studies are performed to identify how much and how frequently predators need to be introduced through the definition of a threshold value, as a function of various parameters. We show that the best strategy to efficiently control the disease depends on the predator mortality: low mortality predators need to be released only once a year, while high mortality predators should be released more frequently to ensure their persistence in the
 plantation. This work hence provides qualitative and quantitative bases for the deployment of predator-based biocontrol, a promising alternative to fungicides for rust control.

We propose a minimal ODE model for facultative mutualism between two species that is based on the differentiation of two subpopulations per species. 
 
 In facultative mutualism between two species, each species benefits from interacting with the other species but does not rely on this interaction to exist and grow. At the species level there is a subdivision into the mutualistic subpopulation that actively interacts with the other species, and the non-mutualistic subpopulation that does not interact with the other species. The non-mutualistic subpopulation behaves the same way the total species’ population would in absence of the other species, but the mutualistic subpopulation additionally receives a benefit due to the mutualistic interaction with the other species’ mutualistic subpopulation. Therefore, in our model the interaction term is not dependent on the density of the two species, as it is the case in the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, but only on the density of the two mutualistic subpopulations. We also took the intraspecific switch of individuals between the two subpopulations into account.
 
 Every mutualistic benefit automatically includes a cost that must be spent in order to provide the benefit for the other species. We investigated to what extent the cost influences the proportion of mutualistic subpopulation in the total species population. If the cost exceeds the benefit for one species, the net-effect of the interaction becomes negative for that species. In that case, the situation no longer refers to mutualism, but to parasitism. We claim that due to this mechanism our model is able to represent several interspecific interactions.",March 2nd,accept,accept,,Send March 3
