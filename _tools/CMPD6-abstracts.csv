I am presenting as part of a minisymposium,-	Modelling the Cancer Microenvironment,MONDAL HASAN,ZAHID,mondalhasanzahid@ufl.edu,,University of Florida,,The biting rate of Aedes aegypti and its variability: A systematic review (1970 - 2022),"Background

Transmission models have a long history in the study of mosquito-borne disease dynamics. The mosquito biting rate (MBR) is an important parameter in these models, however, estimating its value empirically is complex. Modeling studies obtain biting rate values from various types of studies, each of them having its strengths and limitations. Thus, understanding these study designs and the factors that contribute to MBR estimates and their variability is an important step towards standardizing these estimates. We do this for an important arbovirus vector Aedes aegypti. 

Methodology/Principal Findings

We perform a systematic review using search terms such as ‘biting rate’ and ‘biting frequency’ combined with ‘Aedes aegypti’ (‘Ae. aegypti’ or ‘A. aegypti’). We screened 3,201 articles from PubMed and ProQuest databases, of which 21 met our inclusion criteria. Two broader types of studies are identified: human landing catch (HLC) studies and multiple feeding studies. We analyze the biting data provided as well as the methodologies used in these studies to characterize the variability of these estimates across temporal, spatial, and environmental factors and to identify the strengths and limitations of existing methodologies. Based on these analyses, we present two approaches to estimate population mean per mosquito biting rate: one that combines studies estimating the number of bites taken per gonotrophic cycle and the gonotrophic cycle duration, and a second that uses data from histological studies. Based on one histological study dataset, we estimate biting rates of Ae. aegypti (0.60 and 0.56 bite/mosquito-day in Thailand and Puerto Rico, respectively). 

Conclusions/Significance

Our review reinforces the importance of engaging with vector biology when using mosquito biting data in transmission modeling studies. For Ae. aegypti, this includes understanding the variation of the gonotrophic cycle duration and the number of bites per gonotrophic cycle, as well as recognizing the potential for spatial and temporal variability. To address these variabilities, we advocate for site-specific data and the development of a standardized approach to estimate the biting rate.

People living with HIV (PLWH) older than age 55 have an enhanced risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is further unclear whether multiple standard doses of COVID-19 vaccines elicit a durable immunity in this population or whether the vaccines can destabilize HIV reservoirs. In this talk I will discuss our unpublished work where we followed n = 91 PLWH aged 55+ and n = 23 age-matched HIV- individuals over a period of 48 weeks following COVID-19 dose one, capturing longitudinal immunological outcomes from two subsequent booster doses.  I will introduce the longitudinal immunological findings for IgG, memory-B cells, and cytokines (IFNg and IL2). I will then motivate our novel within-host immunological model which couples these quantities together, and the findings of our fits to determine dose-dependent decay rates and half life values.  Model fit findings, practical identifiability concerns, and biological implications of the within-host modelling approach will be discussed. ",Feb 21st,accept,accept,,sent Feb 24th,MS-C2,,C2,

Exosomal miRNAs of breast cancer are known to enter the bone and degrade it, which facilitates cancer cells invasion into the bone interior and ensures its successful colonization. In this paper we use a mathematical

keeps the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. We next demonstrate how breast cancer exosomal miRNAs disrupt this balance, either by increasing or by decreasing the ratio of osteoclasts/osteoblasts, which results in abnormal high bone resorption or abnormal high bone forming, respectively, and in bone weakening in both cases. Finally we consider the case of

The causes behind the initiation, progression, and ultimate resistance of this cancer is unknown, though it is recognized that two cellular phenotypes underpin its deadliness: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES). How these phenotypes influence the eco-evolutionary dynamics of neuroblastoma cell populations (especially under therapy) remains a mystery. This is due to the confusion surrounding whether the ADRN and MES phenotypes represent different cell types (species) or cell states (stages in the life cycle of a single species). This distinction is critical in understanding and ultimately treating neuroblastoma. In this talk, we will introduce theoretical methods to model the eco-evolutionary dynamics in state-structured neuroblastoma populations and use these models to tease apart cell type vs. cell state hypotheses. We will then expand and generalize this framework to continuous-structured models and discuss implications for cancer and bacterial resistance more generally.",Feb 21st,accept,accept,,sent Feb 24th ,X,,,C1

Classical mathematical models have predicted that the consumer and predator exclude the others in environments with low and high productivity, respectively, and that they can coexist only in environments with intermediate productivity. However, empirical results show that consumers persist in highly productive environments. Thus, the prevalence of intraguild predation in fertile environments has long been puzzling to the ecologist.

At the CMPD5, We showed that the quality of the resource and consumer as diets to the predator is the essential parameter to determine the dynamics of the IGP system and verified that the consumer never becomes extinct when it is not beneficial to the predator. Furthermore, not the consumer but the predator may become extinct when the consumer is not profitable for the predator. In this presentation, we challenge the supposed necessary condition for coexistence, that consumers must be superior in resource competition. We will show that large amplitude oscillations in the resource-predator system allow the consumer to increase and coexist with predators even if the former is inferior in resource competition Furthermore, if the resource-consumer system is oscillatory, the predator is forced
to become extinct when environmental productivity is high. Therefore, the fates of the consumer and predator in the oscillatory systems are very different from those in the stationary systems. To fully understand the intraguild predation system, it is necessary to examine nonlinear dynamics in detail.

virus. The earlier developed drugs, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) analogues, have been shown to be effective in suppressing HBV viral load (VL) in patients with chronic infection. However, these drugs need to be taken for a lifetime to maintain VL suppression, creating the risk of adverse effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of the virus. The development of a new class of drugs, the capsid protein allosteric modulators (CpAMs), has created renewed hope for finding a functional cure for HBV. These drugs inhibit the encapsidation of polymerase-pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) in infected cells. We developed a multiscale age-structured model of HBV. Our model incorporates the intracellular and extracellular dynamics of HBV RNA and DNA and keeps track of the age of infection of infected hepatocytes. We derived an equivalent ODE system for our multiscale model and fitted the reduced model to the viral loads of chronic HBV patients treated with CpAMs and NTRIs, to understand the efficacies of the drugs.",Feb 21st,,,,,MS-E4,,E4,

Moreover, durable viral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 generated after infection in naïve hosts or after vaccination is of high importance, given its implication for protection from severe disease. To better understand the formation and function of cellular immunological memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a mechanistic, computational model of COVID-19 immunopathology that explicitly describes the interactions between epithelial cells, innate and adaptive immune cells, and cytokines, as well as the differentiation process of naïve CD8+ T cells into effector and memory cell subsets. Through calibration and validation against a broad range of experimental and clinical immunological data, we studied heterogeneity in CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Using our model, we identified key mechanisms distinguishing COVID-19 severity and reducing inflammation in reinfections using a virtual patient cohort. These include the monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation rate, the IFN production rate by infected cells, and the monocyte recruitment rate. Our results show that memory CD8+ T cell generation is critical to offering durable protection against severe COVID-19 and reduces heterogeneous outcomes upon re-exposure to the same virus. We can also apply our model to predict the humoral immune response post-vaccination to study breakthrough infections.

By integrating the age structure and interregional migration, this model allows us to evaluate the impact of interregional migration on the population growth rate. 
 We have found a theorem that expresses the eigensystem of the multiregional Leslie matrix using eigenvalues and matrix elements. Using this theorem, we can estimate the contribution of each region to the descendants and the percentage of ancestors in each region in a steady state.
  For example, in Japan, which has been in a phase of population decline since 2010, there is not only a declining birthrate and an aging population but also a problem of uneven population movement due to the concentration of the population in Tokyo. A sensitivity analysis based on our analysis results and the national census can clarify the mathematical structure of population decline. In this study, we apply our theory to Japanese governmental statistics from 2010 to 2020 to numerically evaluate the impact of age-specific and regional migration and fertility rates on population decline.

Natural selection selects for cells capable of efficient nutrient uptake. Cancer cells achieve this by overexpressing angiogenic factors (VEGF) that induce the formation of blood vessels that carry nutrients to the tumor. Traditionally, angiogenesis has been viewed as a cooperative phenomenon resulting in the evolution of free-loaders. Using a game theoretic framework, we model VEGF production as an evolutionary strategy and show that the over-production of VEGF is the result of a tragedy of commons.
 
 A cell’s investment in VEGF depends on the degree to which it aids its nutrient uptake. If higher production of VEGF leads to higher nutrient uptake, then cells are incentivized to produce VEGF. If nutrients are equally divided within a given neighborhood, an individual cell’s incentive to produce VEGF decreases. Our simulations predict that cancer cells produce 100 times more VEGF than typically seen in normal cells, and what would be their collective team optimum. This means that VEGF production by a cancer cell aims to co-opt nutrients from neighboring cells resulting in an evolutionary arms race. Increasing the number of cancer cells in a fixed neighborhood results in lower per-cell VEGF production while exacerbating the tragedy of the commons collectively. Next, we simulate anti-angiogenesis therapy and find that in response to therapy, cells adopt a low VEGF production strategy that continues to sustain growth in the cancer population. This results in evolutionary rescue. These results are in line with clinical observations. Our model challenges the existing paradigm of angiogenesis as a cooperative activity and provides novel insights into therapy in a clinical setting.",March 1st,accept,accept,,Send March 3,X,,,C1

Although the number of reported cases and deaths in sub-Saharan Africa has been relatively low compared to other regions, it is unclear how much of this is due to low testing rates and reporting capacity. Moreover, the region's high prevalence of infectious diseases and malnutrition may weaken the immune system and increase the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Despite these challenges, it appears that individuals in sub-Saharan Africa have mounted robust immune responses to the virus, suggesting that factors such as prior exposure to similar viruses and genetic differences may have played a role in priming their immune response to COVID-19. Immune response priming, the process by which the immune system is prepared to respond to a future infection, can occur through various mechanisms, including natural infection or vaccination. Using mathematical modeling we hope to shed some light in the ongoing research that is needed to fully understand the immune response to COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa.",March 1st,,,,,MS-E4,,E4,

Recently, a particular attention has been paid to reinfection models in epidemiology. To cite a few, threshold conditions for infection, reinfection and endemicity of various SIRS models are studied in [Gomes and al. 2004], global stability of SEIRS model in [Li and Muldowney 1999], bifurcation analysis for a SIRI model presenting different contact rates for infection and reinfection in [Pagliara and al., 2018], and models counting reinfections in [Katriel, 2011], [Fang and Bliman, 2022]. Nevertheless, in most studies on reinfection, the infection and reinfection processes are assumed to behave essentially in the same way, which is quite limitative.
 
 With the aim of understanding the effects induced by differences between the stage of primo-infection and further reinfections,
 we introduce here an 8-dimensional two-stage SEIRS reinfection model in which the parameters characteristic of the disease dynamics are different for the primo-infection and for the following reinfections.
 The value of the basic reproduction number R0 of the model around the (unique) disease-free equilibrium
 is first derived, and the existence of up to two and three endemic equilibria, respectively in the cases R0 &lt;= 1 and R0&gt;1, is theoretically established under appropriate conditions on the system parameters.

The pre-treatment immune state of the TIME is associated with treatment outcome; immunologically hot tumors generally exhibit better responses to radio- and immunotherapy than cold tumors. However, radiotherapy is known to induce paradoxical immunological consequences, resulting in both immunostimulatory and inhibitory responses. In fact, it is thought that the radiation-induced tumoricidal immune response is curtailed by subsequent applications of radiation. It is thus conceivable that spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT), administered through GRID blocks to create areas of low or high dose exposure, may protect regions of the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby preserving anti-tumor immune responses. We use an agent-based model of tumor-immune interaction to investigate the therapeutic utility of SFRT. We evaluate the immunological consequences of various GRID architectures, radiation doses and dose scheduling, to identify which GRID architectures result in superior immune infiltration for each pre-treatment immune state.

 Fungal diseases cause serious damages in crop worldwide. In particular, coffee leaf rust (CLR), caused by fungus Hemileia vastatrix attacks coffee leaves and reduces coffee yield.
 Its control mainly relies on cultural practices, fungicides, resistant cultivars and biocontrol using hyperparasites. Fungicides are widely used, but have harmful ecological impact an
 important costs; the other methods need careful analysis for their deployment to be successful on the long term.
 This work presents a multi-seasonal model of the CLR development in the coffee plantation with continuous dynamics during the rainy season and a discrete event to represent
 the simpler dynamics during the dry season. Biological control using predators through one or more discrete introduction events over the year is then added. Analytical and semi-numerical studies are performed to identify how much and how frequently predators need to be introduced through the definition of a threshold value, as a function of various parameters. We show that the best strategy to efficiently control the disease depends on the predator mortality: low mortality predators need to be released only once a year, while high mortality predators should be released more frequently to ensure their persistence in the
 plantation. This work hence provides qualitative and quantitative bases for the deployment of predator-based biocontrol, a promising alternative to fungicides for rust control.

We propose a minimal ODE model for facultative mutualism between two species that is based on the differentiation of two subpopulations per species. 
 
 In facultative mutualism between two species, each species benefits from interacting with the other species but does not rely on this interaction to exist and grow. At the species level there is a subdivision into the mutualistic subpopulation that actively interacts with the other species, and the non-mutualistic subpopulation that does not interact with the other species. The non-mutualistic subpopulation behaves the same way the total species’ population would in absence of the other species, but the mutualistic subpopulation additionally receives a benefit due to the mutualistic interaction with the other species’ mutualistic subpopulation. Therefore, in our model the interaction term is not dependent on the density of the two species, as it is the case in the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, but only on the density of the two mutualistic subpopulations. We also took the intraspecific switch of individuals between the two subpopulations into account.
 
 Every mutualistic benefit automatically includes a cost that must be spent in order to provide the benefit for the other species. We investigated to what extent the cost influences the proportion of mutualistic subpopulation in the total species population. If the cost exceeds the benefit for one species, the net-effect of the interaction becomes negative for that species. In that case, the situation no longer refers to mutualism, but to parasitism. We claim that due to this mechanism our model is able to represent several interspecific interactions.",March 2nd,accept,accept,,Send March 3,X,,,EO2

 We propose to develop a mechanistic model based on the quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling, which is one of the main computational approaches used to discover, test, and predict dose-exposure response. One of the main challenges of the QSP modeling is parameter estimation. Traditionally, these models assume all patients have similar diseases, and the values of parameters of the QSP model are identical for all patients. Therefore, parameters are commonly calibrated using the data often assembled from disparate sources.
  
 To develop a personalized DT, we use patient-specific data for parameter estimations, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification. For each patient, we estimate the values of parameters of their QSP model using their data. We perform a multi-dimensional sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification on the mechanistic model to find a set of critical interactions and predict the intervals of confidence. Since this QSP model includes the data-driven mechanistic model of cells and molecules' interaction networks, one of the ultimate results of this DT is the prediction of evolution of cancer in response to a given targeted therapy.",March 14th,,,,,MS-C3,,C3,

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated, over the recent years, impressive clinical response in cancer patients, but some patients do not respond at all to checkpoint blockade, exhibiting primary resistance. Primary resistance to PD-1 blockade is reported to occur under conditions of immunosuppressive tumor environment, a condition caused by myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and by T cells exclusion, due to increased level of T regulatory cells (Tregs). Since TGF-β activates Tregs, TGF-β inhibitor may overcome primary resistance to anti-PD1. Indeed, recent mice experiments show that combining anti-PD-1 with anti-TGF-β yields significant therapeutic improvements compared to anti-TGF-β alone.
 Results. The present paper introduces two cancer-specific parameters and, correspondingly, develops a mathematical model which explains how primary resistance to PD-1 blockade occurs, in terms of the two cancer-specific parameters, and how, in combination with anti-TGF-β, anti-PD-1 provides significant benefits. The model is represented by a system of partial differential equations and the simulations are in agreement with the recent mice experiments. In some cancer patients, treatment with anti-PD-1 results in rapid progression of the disease, known as hyperprogression disease (HPD). The mathematical model can also explain how this situation arises, and it predicts that HPD may be reversed by combining anti-TGF-β to anti-PD-1. Conclusion. The model is used to demonstrate how the two cancer-specific parameters may serve as biomarkers in predicting the efficacy of combination therapy with PD-1 and TGF-β inhibitors.",March 14th,,,,,MS-C3,,C3,

Using multi-source data, we initially determine the viral dynamics and estimate the relationship between viral load and infectiousness. Then, we embed the viral dynamics model into a four-layer contact network and formulate an agent-based model to simulate between-host transmission. The results illustrate that the heterogeneity of immune response between children and adults and between vaccinated and unvaccinated infections can reproduce different transmission patterns. We find that school closures play a significant effect on mitigating the pandemic as more adults get vaccinated and the virus mutates. If enough infected individuals are diagnosed by testing before symptom onset and then treated quickly, the transmssion can also be effectively curbed.

The model assumes two time-delays: (i) the time between viral entry into a target susceptible cell and the production of new virus particles and (ii) duration of the first stage of delayed immune response to HPV population growing. The model of cell population dynamics is described by the initial-boundary value problem for the semilinear hyperbolic equations with age- and time-dependent coefficients and time delay and the dynamics of HPV virus is described by nonlinear delayed ODE. The model considers the immune functional response of organism by the HPV-density dependent death rate. The numerical method is based on the method of characteristics for the semi-linear hyperbolic equations, trapezoidal rules for integrals and has the second order of approximation. 
 Convergence of the numerical approximations is studied both theoretically and numerically. We prove the stability and second rate of convergence of the approximate solutions to the exact solution of the SIPCV epidemic nonlinear system. Numerical experiments with vanished mesh spacing illustrate the convergence of numerical solution to the benchmark solution.

The population scale epidemiological model is linked to the within-host model which describes the HIV and opioid dynamics in a co-affected individual. CD4 cells and viral load data obtained from morphine addicted SIV-infected monkeys are used to validate the within-host model. AIDS diagnoses, HIV death and opioid mortality data are used to fit the between-host model. When the rates of viral clearance and morphine uptake are fixed, the within-host model is structurally identifiable. If in addition the morphine saturation and clearance rates are also fixed the model becomes practical identifiable.
 Analytical results of the multi-scale model suggest that in addition to the disease-addiction-free equilibrium, there is a unique HIV-only and opioid-only equilibrium. Each of the boundary equilibria
 is stable if the invasion number of the other epidemic is below one. Elasticity analysis suggests that the most sensitive number is the invasion number of opioid epidemic with respect to the parameter of enhancement of HIV infection of opioid-affected individual.

Among-type transitions are inspired by the Tug-of-War process introduced in Mcfarland et al. (2014) as a mathematical model for competition of advantageous driver mutations and deleterious passenger mutations in cancer cells. We introduce a version of the model in which a driver mutation pushes the state of the cell L-units up, while a passenger mutation pulls it 1 unit down. The distribution of time to divisions depends on the type of cell, which is an integer. First, we analyze the probability of extinction of the process, using approach in Hautphenne (2013). Then, we consider the properties of the mean process, using theories in Seneta (2006). Finally, we consider the process in an infinitely long cell lineage of cells, using theory of difference equations in Bodine (2015), martingales, and random walk. The analysis leads to the result that under driver dominance, the process escapes to infinity, while under passenger dominance, it leads to a limit distribution. Our analysis reveals an asymmetric relationship between impacts of the two types of mutations. The process is driven to extinction with probability less than 1. Under passenger dominance regime (downward-trend) there exists with a positive probability a ""reservoir"" of cells with a wide range of types (fitnesses). In the context of cancer cell populations, this may mean that ""indolent"" cancer cell colonies may allow the biological process to rebound if conditions change, as in the ""punctuated equilibria"" theory of cancer evolution in Gao et al.

It occurs more during the dry season when the bushes are dry and burned in preparation for the farming season, making the rodents move into human habitats for food to survive. The rodents excrete their faeces and contaminate the environment making environmental transmission vital in Lassa fever transmission dynamics. Therefore, studying the contaminated environment's impact on Lassa fever is essential. This study used a deterministic model to examine the situation of Lassa fever transmission incorporating two environmental pathway transmissions. First, the model's stability is established regarding the model's basic reproduction number, R_0.

The characteristics of disease propagation evolve with time, as a result of a multitude of environmental and anthropic factors, including social distancing.

 In the absence of appropriate external data sources, to correctly describe disease propagation, I propose a flexible methodology, based on stochastic models for disease dynamics, and on Brownian processes for parameter evolution. Using such a diffusion process has the advantage of not requiring a specific mathematical function for the parameter dynamics. Coupled with Bayesian inference using Particle MCMC, this approach allows us to reconstruct both the time evolution of some key parameters of an epidemiological dynamic and its incidence.

The burden of these diseases is different for different regions, being highest in tropical and subtropical areas, which have high annual rainfall, warm temperatures, and less pronounced seasonality. The life cycle of mosquitoes consists of four distinct stages: eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. These life stages have different mortality rates and only adults can reproduce. Seasonal weather may affect the population dynamics of mosquitoes, and the relative abundance of different mosquito stages, since the maturation rate to the next stage depends on temperature, and because egg survival depends on rainfall. We developed a stage-structured model that considers laboratory experiments describing how temperature and rainfall affects the reproduction, maturation and survival of different Anopheles mosquito stages, the species that transmits the parasite that causes malaria. We consider seasonal temperature and rainfall patterns and describe the stage-structured population dynamics of the Anopheles mosquito in Ain Mahbel, Algeria, Cape Town, South Africa, Nairobi, Kenya and Kumasi, Ghana. We find that regional differences in seasonal weather patterns affect mosquito population dynamics. Control strategies often target one specific life stage, for example, applying larvicides to kill mosquito larvae, or spraying insecticides to kill adult mosquitoes. Our findings suggest that differences in seasonal weather patterns affect mosquito stage structure, and best approaches to vector control may vary between regions.",March 28th,accept,accept,,Sent on March 29,X,,,EO1

 The region Emilia-Romagna (one of the most affected areas) has in place since 2013 an extended surveillance program of both mosquitoes and corvids. We have analysed these data through an SEI-SEIR model where several parameters depend on temperature, as shown in laboratory experiments, while over-wintering occurs through infected diapausing mosquitoes.
 We found that an essential factor determining human risk is spring temperature, as confirmed also by a statistical analysis of European data. Another important factor for epidemic dynamics in a given year is pre-existing immunity in birds; as no serological data exist, we reconstructed the trend of seroprevalence over the years, which however has no clear relation with epidemic intensities.

However, daily adherence to a drug regimen can be difficult to maintain and may come with side-effects. In contrast, the IPERGAY study published in 2015 suggested that short-term use around the time of exposure may be just as effective at reducing HIV risk as daily use. Here we investigate short-term use, termed ""on-demand"" or ""event-based"" PrEP. We aim to make model-based predictions of effective on-demand drug regimen. Focusing on transmission through sexual exposure, we incorporate a deterministic model of tissue-level pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of Truvada into a branching-process model of early HIV infection.

The present study aimed to reveal the relationship between the transmissibility of COVID-19 in Tokyo, Osaka, and Aichi prefectures and the daily night-time population in metropolitan areas belonging to each prefecture. 
 Methods: In Japan, the de facto population estimated from GPS-based location data from mobile phone users is regularly monitored by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and other health departments. Combined with this data, we conducted Ta time series linear regression analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between daily reported case counts of COVID-19 in Tokyo, Osaka, and Aichi, and night-time de facto population estimated from mobile phone location data, from February 2020 to May 2022. As an approximation of the effective reproduction number, the weekly ratio of cases was used. Models using night-time population with lags ranging from 7 to 14 days were tested. In time-varying regression analysis, the night-time population level and the daily change in night-time population level were included as explanatory variables. In the fixed-effect regression analysis, the inclusion of either the night-time population level or daily change, or both, as explanatory variables was tested, and autocorrelation was adjusted by introducing first-order autoregressive error of residuals. In both regression analyses, the lag of night-time population used in best fit models was determined using the information criterion. 
 Results: In the time-varying regression analysis, night-time population level tended to show positive to neutral effects on COVID-19 transmission, whereas the daily change of night-time population showed neutral to negative effects. The fixed-effect regression analysis revealed that for Tokyo and Osaka, regression models with 8-day-lagged night-time population level and daily change were the best fit, whereas in Aichi, the model using only the 9-day-lagged night-time population level was the best fit using the widely applicable information criterion. For all regions, the best-fit model suggested a positive relationship between night-time population and transmissibility, which was maintained over time. 
 Conclusions: Our results revealed that regardless of the period of interest, a positive relationship between night-time population levels and COVID-19 dynamics was observed. The introduction of vaccinations and major outbreaks of Omicron BA. 2 subvariants in Japan did not dramatically change the relationship between night-time population and COVID-19 dynamics in three megacities in Japan.

To mitigate the loss of lives, emergency use authorization was given to several monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 patients with a high risk of progressing to severe disease. Monoclonal antibodies used to treat SARS-CoV-2 target the spike protein of the virus and block its ability to enter and infect target cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy can thus accelerate the decline in viral load, which results in a lower hospitalization rate among high-risk patients. However, viral resistance has been observed, in some cases leading to a transient viral rebound that can be as large as 3-4 logs. Indeed, resistance has compromised the use of all previously authorized monoclonal antibodies. Although resistance can be expected, the large rebounds observed are much more difficult to explain. We hypothesize replenishment of target cells is necessary to generate the high transient viral rebound. Thus, we formulated two models with different mechanisms for target cell replenishment and fit them to data from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals treated with a monoclonal antibody. We showed that both models can explain the emergence of resistant virus associated with high transient viral rebounds. We found that variations in the target cell supply rate and adaptive immunity parameters have a strong impact on the magnitude or observability of the viral rebound associated with the emergence of resistant virus, which may explain why only some individuals develop observable transient resistant viral rebound.

The IFD can readily be translated into mathematical terms for models wherein the environment is spatially varying but temporally constant. In this talk we will discuss how this is done across a range of modeling formats and how it consequently leads to predictions of evolutionary advantage in such modeling formats. We then report on ongoing efforts to define the ideal free distribution mathematically in cases when the environment varies in both space and time, focusing on the case wherein habitats vary periodically in time.",April 3rd,,,,,MS-E7,,E7,

However, they suffer from high computational costs—especially if the stochastic nature of phenotypic transitions is included in the formulation of the model. To address these limitations, we have developed two multiscale ABMs, one avascular and one vascular, and calibrated them to experimental data.
 
 The avascular model is a coarse-grained two-scale ABM (cgABM) calibrated with time-resolved microscopy measurements of BT474 human breast carcinoma cells grown with different initial conditions. The model consists of a reaction-diffusion type model capturing the spatiotemporal evolution of glucose and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment, coupled with a lattice-free ABM to simulate individual cell dynamics. We perform a global sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of model parameters, followed by a Bayesian calibration that accounts for the stochasticity of the cgABM. The results show that the cgABM can reliably predict the spatiotemporal evolution of breast cancer cells observed by microscopy data.
 
 The vascularized multiscale model of tumor angiogenesis combines an ABM of tumor and endothelial cell dynamics with a continuum model that captures the spatiotemporal variations in the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor. We first calibrate ordinary differential equation models to time-resolved protein concentration data to estimate the rates of secretion and consumption of vascular endothelial growth factor by endothelial and tumor cells, respectively. These parameters are then input into the multiscale model while the remaining model parameters are calibrated to time-resolved confocal microscopy images obtained within a 3D vascularized microfluidic platform. The model is able to globally recapitulate angiogenic vasculature density. Additionally, the model's ability to predict local vessel morphology is assessed and shows promising results.
 
 Our multiscale ABMs demonstrate the ability to predict tumor growth and angiogenesis with experimental data, providing a platform for systematic testing of mathematical predictions of tumor dynamics.",April 3rd,,,,,MS-C1,,C1,

In response, our team began producing weekly forecasts for the most heavily afflicted areas. As the case levels have significantly decreased, evaluating model performance is essential to advance the growing field of epidemic forecasting. We obtained reported Mpox case data from the CDC and OWID teams through the week of 1/26/2023 to produce retrospective weekly forecasts (e.g., 1-week, 2-week, 3-week, and 4-week) for study areas using auto-regressive moving average (ARIMA), general additive model (GAM), simple linear regression (SLR), spatial-wave, and ensemble n-sub-epidemic modeling frameworks. Model performance was then compared via MSE, MAE, WIS, and 95% PI coverage metrics. The spatial-wave modeling framework performed superior across most locations and forecasting horizons in average MSE, MAE, and WIS compared to the other included frameworks. It was followed closely in success by the n-sub-epidemic top-ranked, weighted, and un-weighted ensemble (2) models. Regarding average 95% PI coverage, the n-sub-epidemic unweighted ensemble (2) model performed best across all forecasting horizons for most locations. However, there was more widespread success noted across all modeling frameworks, with many locations seeing multiple models performing equally well in terms of average 95% PI coverage. Model performance tended to increase as we entered the declining phase of the outbreak. Overall, the spatial-wave and ensemble n-sub-epidemic frameworks outperformed other established models (e.g., ARIMA, SLR, GAM). Similar to past performance under different scenarios (e.g., COVID-19), the success seen with both frameworks highlights the continued utility of the models for short-term forecasting epidemic outbreaks.",April 3rd,,,,,MS-E6,,E6,

 Clusters, defined as a group of cases that share common place of transmission, have characterized local dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, and Japan is one of a few countries that continued to survey clustering events classified by social settings. Japanese government referred to cluster data to design and implement public health and social measures(PHSM), but little has been clarified with respect to the transmission mechanisms of epidemic that propagates with certain types of clusters. Here we aimed to analyze the temporal dynamics of clustering using the cluster surveillance data in Japan. 
 
 Methods:
 Clusters were classified into healthcare facility, welfare facility, school, working place, recreation event, and eating and drinking establishment. The number of cases who were unlinked was simultaneously recorded. We employed the vector autoregression linear non-gaussian acyclic model (VAR-LiNGAM) to describe the time-series causal mechanisms among different types of clusters as a function of time. The reliability of VAR-LiNGAM was assessed by bootstrapping method.
 
 Results:
 Eating and drinking establishment and workplace were identified as constituting “upper stream” of the temporal order of clustering, and healthcare and welfare facilities tended to be dead-end. The upper-stream clusters predicted subsequent clusters for about 5 weeks ahead. We reconstructed the chain of those clustering patterns. The effectiveness of PHSM that focused on eating and drinking establishment at nights was assessed.

 Mobility restrictions were commonly used to limit interaction with other people and stop the spatial spread of the COVID-19 infection. A statistical model was developed to estimate the number of imported cases in each Japanese prefecture using epidemiological data and inter-prefectural mobility.
 Methods
 The inter-prefectural mobility rate based on mobile phone data and prevalence estimates in the origin prefectures was used to predict the number of imported cases crossing prefectural borders. Using surveillance data of cases with a history of inter-prefectural travel, the simplistic model was quantified. The impact of the mobility rate and prevalence at the origin on imported cases was then explored with simulations. 
 Results
 Compared with the observed number of imported cases, the overall pattern was captured over time. Although Hokkaido and Okinawa are northernmost and southernmost prefectures, respectively, they were sensitive to differing prevalence rates in Tokyo and Osaka and the mobility rate. Other prefectures were also sensitive to mobility change, assuming that an increment in the mobility rate was seen in all prefectures.
 Conclusions
 Our findings indicate the need to account for the weight of an inter-prefectural mobility network when implementing human mobility-related countermeasures. If the mobility rate were maintained lower than the observed rate, the number of imported cases could have been maintained at lower levels than the observed, potentially preventing the unnecessary spatial spread of COVID-19 in late 2020.",April 3rd,,,,,MS-E6,,E6,

The epidemiological data indicate that protection from the flu and COVID-19 vaccines could wane within a year. Our recent studies showed that the previously proposed extension of the Cox proportional hazards model by utilizing scaled Schoenfeld residuals used to estimate waning of vaccine effectiveness (VE) fails to accurately capture fast intraseasonal waning, especially when vaccination is spread over months. However, a relatively simple method based on including time-vaccine interaction in the model, with further proposed optimization, performs significantly better (Nikas et al., Clinical Infectious Diseases 2022). Population heterogeneities, both in underlying (pre-vaccination) susceptibility and vaccine response, add additional challenge in VE estimation, as they can cause measured VE to change over time even in the absence of pathogen evolution and any actual waning of immune responses. We use a multi-scale agent-based model parameterized using epidemiological and immunological data to investigate the effect of these heterogeneities. Our study suggests heterogeneity is more likely to ‘bias’ VE estimates downwards towards faster waning of immunity but a subtle bias in the opposite direction is also plausible.",April 3rd,,,,,MS-E5,,E5,

Prescribed fires are a common form of land management practices; it is time and cost-efficient when applied across large amounts of land. In this seminar, I investigate the effects of prescribed fire intensity and the duration between burns on the prevalence of tick-borne illnesses as temperature rises. Using stage-structured tick-host models with impulsive differential equations our results indicate that prescribed fire intensity has a larger impact in reducing disease prevalence than frequency between burns.

Health seeking behaviour such as testing and access of healthcare services are important considerations that impact how cases are identified through surveillance systems. In mathematical modelling, cases reported to surveillance systems are often used for retrospective and prospective analysis. METHODS: An age-stratified SIR model that incorporates case detection for influenza is described. Influenza data and case detections rates for influenza seasons (2016-2019) were estimated from Alberta Health’s administrative data. Incorporating constant and time dependent case detection rates in the model will be compared across retrospective (i.e. assess fitting using all data from each season) and prospective (i.e. performance of projections) analysis. RESULTS: Retrospective analysis showed comparable fitting results of influenza cases using both constant and time dependent case detection rates, however the final size differed. Influenza projections performed better using time dependent compared to constant case detection rates. CONCLUSION: It is important to consider implications of incorporating model assumptions that may appear to ‘fit well to data’.

The model consists of a basic model that simulates clonal expansions and an observation process that represents the detection procedures. We consider two variants for the basic model, both based on Kendall's birth-death branching process: the first with Poisson migration, which models recurrent mutations from a fixed number of hematopoietic stem cells in spatially constrained niches, and the second with a single clone's expansion with a random starting time point. The latter variant assumes that a single mutation event gives rise to the observed mutant clones, which is appropriate when mutations only occur once. The observation process is a binomial sampling with the sequencing coverage as the total number of samples and the ratio of mutants from the basic model as the probability of detection. We also introduce multiple-timepoint observations and formulate the model as a Hidden Markov Model, which can be estimated using Sequential Monte Carlo methods. Particularly, we derive the pmf of the two-timepoint model for estimation and the transition probability within the hidden layer.
 
 Our basic model, particularly Kendall's birth-death branching process with Poisson migration, produces comparable results to Watson et al. (2020), which can be seen as an approximation of our model under a low mutation rate. Our model's predictions are consistent with the sequencing data from nearly 50,000 healthy individuals in various studies.

This basic bifurcation theorem will be related to the reproduction number R₀, for which we provide a general definition. We also give an extension of this fundamental bifurcation phenomenon for periodic disease-free and endemic cycles. I will illustrate the application of the theorems using a few specific disease models.",,,,,,,P,,

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is used here to identify the behavior of a biological system from a global perspective. Using data sets of the immune response during influenza-pneumococcal co-infection in mice and kinetic data of COVID-19 patients with different disease severity, we employ the mapper algorithm to simplify and visualize high dimensional data sets. Persistent shapes of the simplicial complexes of the data in the infection scenarios are found. In this talk, we will hypothesize that the shape of the infection impacts immunity and subsequent severity.

A unique feature of nucleoplasm—the fluid of the nucleus—is that it contains chromatin (DNA) and RNA. In contrast to other important biological polymer hydrogels, such as mucus and extracellular matrix, the nucleic acid polymers have a sequence that encodes both genetic information and strongly influences spatial organization. How does crowding in a sequence specific hydrogel influence spatial organization of the dynamic molecular components responsible for nuclear function? We are becoming increasingly aware of the role of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cellular processes in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Complex molecular interactions over a wide range of timescales can cause large biopolymers (RNA, protein, etc) to phase separate from the surrounding nucleoplasm or cytoplasm into distinct biocondensates (spherical droplets in the simplest cases). I will discuss recent work modelling the role of nuclear biocondensates in neurodegenerative disease and several ongoing projects related to modelling and microscopy image analysis.",,,,,,,P,,

Immunity can also decay over time, because of natural degradation, or because a pathogen evolves, lessening the protective effects of immunity in a host. We have developed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Fitting the models to in-host measures of the immune response and/or pathogen or vaccine load, we quantify the production and decay of the humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune response. Results are translated to the population level to quantify distributions of immunity by age. These models are used to help inform decision-makers in developing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical intervention programs.

Screening to confirm dengue seropositivity is therefore recommended before vaccination. Recent studies suggest that the closely-related Zika virus may also interact with dengue through ADE. The study presented in this talk uses a mathematical model to evaluate the likely impact of imperfect screening and dengue vaccination on the spread of both viruses in a population where only one dengue serotype circulates, although the vaccine may take against any or all of the four recognized serotypes. Analysis focuses on the viruses' reproductive numbers. Results indicate that vaccination increases Zika's spread through induced ADE, while its impact on the spread of dengue depends on screening specificity and serotype-specific vaccine efficacies, as well as the intensity of ADE. Numerical analysis identifies the roles played by age-in and catch-up vaccination as well as screening characteristics and prior dengue exposure.",April 11,,,,,MS-E3,,E3,

 to the external environment. In particular, we shall consider cell migration on the extracellular matrix (ECM) and two phenomena named contact guidance and steric hindrance
 depending on a single external cue (the ECM) that affects in a twofold way the polarization
 and speed of motion of the cells. We start from a microscopic description of the stochastic
 processes underlying the cell re-orientation mechanism related to the change of cell speed and
 direction. Then, we formally derive the corresponding kinetic model that implements exactly
 the prescribed microscopic dynamics and, from it, it is possible to deduce the macroscopic limit
 in the appropriate regime. Moreover, we test our model in several scenarios. In particular, we
 numerically investigate the minimal microscopic mechanisms that are necessary to reproduce
 cell dynamics by comparing the outcomes of our model with some experimental results related
 to breast cancer cell migration. This allows us to validate the proposed modeling approach
 and, also, to highlight its capability of predicting the qualitative cell behaviors in diverse

To address this, a new generalized incidence rate function is proposed, and an SIR compartmental model is studied with a Holling type II saturated treatment rate function. The non-monotonic nature of this incidence rate function has an impact on the stability of endemic equilibria. Backward bifurcation, forward (transcritical) bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, and Hopf bifurcation are observed, leading to the possibility of multiple endemic equilibria and multi-stability. When the model system accounts for the delay in incubation, multiple Hopf bifurcations with the same frequency and two frequency Hopf-Hopf bifurcations exist, resulting in two different oscillatory solutions. The exhibition of these two-frequency oscillations are novel and have not been explored much in epidemiological models.",April 11,accept,accept,,April 11,,,,E

Furthermore, the fitness costs associated with resistance are accounted for, including heterogeneities in fecundity, development rates, and natural mortality rates. The model is used to investigate the spread and management of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. A threshold for the stability of the insecticide-sensitive-only and insecticide-resistant?only boundary equilibria is derived. Moreover, a conjecture has been established for the stability of the co-existence equilibrium where mosquitoes of all genotypes exist. Furthermore, we show

This is particularly true for vector-borne diseases, where within-vector, within-host, and between vector–host populations all play crucial roles in diversity and distribution of the pathogen. Despite recent modeling efforts to determine the effect of within-host virus-immune response dynamics on between-host transmission, the role of within-vector viral dynamics on disease spread is overlooked. Here, we formulate an age-since-infection-structured epidemic model coupled to nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing within-host immune-virus dynamics and within-vector viral kinetics, with feedbacks across these scales. We first define the within-host viral-immune response and within-vector viral kinetics-dependent basic reproduction number ℛ0. Then we prove that whenever ℛ0&lt;1, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, and under certain biologically interpretable conditions, globally asymptotically stable. Otherwise, if ℛ0&gt;1, it is unstable and the system has a unique positive endemic equilibrium. In the special case of constant vector to host inoculum size, we show the positive equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable and the disease is weakly uniformly persistent. Furthermore, numerical results suggest that within-vector-viral kinetics and dynamic inoculum size may play a substantial role in epidemics. Finally, we address how the model can be utilized to better predict the success of control strategies such as vaccination and drug treatment.",April 14th,,,,,MS-E3,,E3,

Recently developed vaccines have been linked to increased risk of severe infection in naive individuals, leading some scientists to advise only vaccination of previously infected individuals or to not deploy any vaccine, whereas other experts have downplayed the risk or suggested the benefits of population-wide vaccination outweigh the risks. Furthermore, researchers have called for more refined antibody screening of the target population since pre-existent antibody level modulates infection severity risk. In this study, we formulate an antibody size-structured multi-scale epi- demic PDE DENV model that is linked to a coupled immunological ODE virus-immune response system. In the model formulation, we consider: (i) waning immunity and immune boosting processes induced by sequential infections via multiple co-circulating DENV strains, (ii) reinfection and vaccination of susceptible and recovered individuals, and (iii) individual and population scale evolving immunity. Via threshold analysis, we derive the strain specific basic reproduction number and invasion numbers along with the equilibria and their stability conditions. Later, via numerical simulations, we show how the bidirectional feedback between immunological scale viral immune kinetics and population scale virus transmission with evolving immunity on both scales can affect population level disease severity and abundance. In particular, we address the question: how can vaccination be employed to eradicate the disease, while avoiding possible severe infection in vaccinated individuals, all at a feasible economic cost?",April 14th,,,,,MS-E5,,E5,

In general, the parameter estimation process will become complicated when some of the model parameters are nonidentifiable. This phenomenon is caused by the non-uniqueness of the best-fit parameter values base on the current available data set. However, those equally good parameter values do not provide consistent prediction results, which significantly reduce the prediction capability of mathematical models. In this talk, we will present a efficient method to help detect the potential nonidentifiable parameters through Singular Value Decomposition and Variance Decomposition (SVD-VD) techniques under the assumption of normally distributed data noise. Then inspired by the classical ridge regression method, a L_2 regularized parameter estimator (RLSE) is proposed to resolve the nonidenfiability issue. It can be demonstrated that RLSE is locally unique, and hence can produce a much more reasonable prediction result. In the last, a numerical example will be provided to test the effectiveness of the SVD-VD method together with the regularized estimator(RLSE).",April 14th,,,,,MS-E1,,E1,
