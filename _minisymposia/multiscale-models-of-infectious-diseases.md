### Description

Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases present a continuous risk to global public health. Over the last two decades we have seen several pandemics across the world, with SARS-CoV-2, HIV, malaria and TB still ongoing. Disease transmission, immune responses, and interventions have been widely studied at different population scales, from molecular to cellular to epidemiological to ecological level. Despite decades of research at each scale, it remains unclear how individual infections or immune response kinetics influence disease incidence at the population level and how population immunity and genetic characteristics affect pathogen evolution inside an infected individual. To advance our understanding of immunobiology and infection we bring together mathematical modelers to determine how to best predict infection, infection pathogenesis and their interaction across biological scales.
