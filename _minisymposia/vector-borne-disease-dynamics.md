<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">Description</h3>

Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, Dengue, Zika, West Nile, Leishmaniasis, Yellow Fever and Lyme disease, constitute about 17% of infectious diseases of humans. Numerous factors, such as climate change, land-use changes, human mobility, urbanization, resistance to insecticide used in vector control and resistance of disease parasites to drug therapies etc., play a major role in the population abundance of the vectors of these diseases, and, consequently, the diseases they cause.  This special session will bring together a group of established and up-and-coming modelers and public health practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art advances made in the mathematical modeling of vector-borne diseases of major public health significance, and to discuss some of the current challenges faced.
