Delay differential equations are ubiquitous in structured population modeling, as soon as transition or maturation times are nontrivial and incorporated into the regulatory dynamics: to quote a pioneering mathematical biologist from the last century, "in all biological phenomena it is necessary to examine not only immediate actions but also those depending on the past". The speakers will present examples of diverse biological phenomena naturally giving rise to delayed systems of differential equations, and illustrate the range of analytical and computational techniques that may developed to gain insight in the behaviour of their solutions.
