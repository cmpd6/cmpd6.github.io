Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in informing public health decisions related to the response to infectious diseases, both new and re-emerging. This includes predictions of case numbers and fatalities, evaluations of the impact of interventions, and decision-making about vaccination and other disease control strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the necessity for robust modeling tools that can accurately reflect the complexity of interactions between the disease, population, pathogen, and interventions. This minisymposium will bring together a diverse group of experts to discuss the ongoing challenges and the latest developments in modelling infectious diseases.
