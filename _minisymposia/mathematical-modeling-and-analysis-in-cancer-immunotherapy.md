Cancer immunotherapy is a novel cancer treatment that activates and restores immune cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. The treatment includes four strategies: immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), cytokines, oncolytic virotherapy (OV), and chimeric antigen receptor T cell treatment (CAR-T cell). There have been many promising developments in cancer immunotherapy, but it is difficult to predict tumor response to a particular treatment. Combining modeling, analysis, and experiments is an innovative approach to overcome these difficulties and help design optimal dosage and treatment schedules. The focus of this session will be on applications of combination of modeling and analysis to the understanding the cell population and design of immunotherapy in cancer.
