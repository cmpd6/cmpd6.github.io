Dispersal is an important ecological process that can significantly affect population dynamics. A myriad of ecological and epidemiological models with dispersal have been developed. Such models are able to provide insights into many important phenomena including species invasion, disease spread and how habitat fragmentation affects species persistence. These models encompass many different modeling approaches including difference equations with discrete patches where time and space are considered discrete, partial differential equations with diffusion where time and space are considered continuous, differential equations with discrete patches where time is considered continuous and space is considered discrete, integrodifference equations where space is treated continuously while time is discrete. 
 
 The purpose of this minisymposium is to bring together researchers to present recent advances on ecological and epidemiological models with dispersal.
