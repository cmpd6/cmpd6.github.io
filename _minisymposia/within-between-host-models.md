<h3 class="font-weight-light mb-3">Description</h3>

The purpose of this special session is to bring together a variety of researchers in within-host and between-host modeling of complex biological systems to report on recent advances in their respective areas and discuss some interesting problems arising in the intersection of these and related areas.  

Some of the possible topics include pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling (PK/PD) and drug resistance modeling, methods of parameter estimations and simulations techniques.
