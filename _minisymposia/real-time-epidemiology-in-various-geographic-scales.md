Mobility restrictions to limit human movement were widely practiced to reduce contact with others and prevent the spatial spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To monitor the possible effectiveness, mobility data were collected as a crucial element for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19, but the usefulness of such datasets for epidemiological evaluation over time has been questioned. In this minisymposium, we will use mathematical and statistical models to better understand the spatiotemporal spread of emerging infectious diseases in real time, using mobility data and epidemiological data. We show that monitoring the night-time population and clusters of cases continues to be crucial for understanding and forecasting the short-term future.
