Epidemic dynamics clearly depends on time-course of infection and immunity within individuals. Another important factor in epidemic dynamics is pathogen evolution whose dynamics depends on within-host processes and between-host transmission.
This minisymposium presents some recent approaches to analyse aspects and special cases of the complex and multi-scale interactions between these processes.
