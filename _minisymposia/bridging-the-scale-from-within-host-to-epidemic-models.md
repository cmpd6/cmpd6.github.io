### Description

Epidemic dynamics clearly depends on time-course of infection and immunity within individuals. Another important factor in epidemic dynamics is pathogen evolution whose dynamics depends on within-host processes and between-host transmission.
This minisymposium presents some recent approaches to analyse aspects and special cases of the complex and multi-scale interactions between these processes.

### Speakers

- Lorenzo Pellis (joint work with Helena Stage, Katrina Lythgoe, Christophe Fraser), Multi-scale time-since-infection models in evolutionary epidemiology
- Veronika Zarnitsyna (Emory University), Competing Heterogeneities in Vaccine Efficacy Estimation
- Nicola Mulberry (Simon Fraser University), A nested model for pneumococcal population dynamics
- Hayriye Guldubak (UL Lafayette), Extrapolating vaccine e?ect to epidemiological impacts in an immuno-epidemiological Dengue vaccination model structured by host antibody level
