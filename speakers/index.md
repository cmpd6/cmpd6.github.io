This page lists participants to the conference, together with information about their "roles": plenary (P), minisymposia (MS) and contributed talks (C) speakers, minisymposium organisers (SO), Scientific (SC) or Local Organising (LO) committees members. 
The list will be expanded as more talks are accepted or abstracts are submitted.
