## Modelling Radiation Cancer Treatment with Ordinary and Fractional Differential Equations

Fractional calculus has recently been applied to mathematical modelling of tumour growth, but itâ€™s use introduces complexities that may not be warranted. Mathematical modelling with differential equations is a standard approach to study and predict
 treatment outcomes for population-level and patient-specific responses. Here we use patient data of radiation-treated tumours to discuss the benefits and limitations of introducing fractional derivatives into three standard models of tumour growth. The
 fractional derivative introduces a history-dependence into the growth function, which requires a continuous death-rate term for radiation treatment. This newly proposed radiation-induced death-rate term improves computational efficiency in both ordinary
 and fractional derivative models. This computational speed-up will benefit common simulation tasks such as model parameterization and the construction and running of virtual clinical trials.
