## Stability Analysis for Integral Equation Disease Models

In the last 20 years, there has been great progress in global stability calculations for many compartmental disease models that are written in terms of ordinary differential equations (ODE) or delay differential equations (DDE). For a model with many compartments, the calculation becomes tricky, because there are many terms that have to cancel out or be bounded by other terms. Nevertheless, numerical evidence often suggests that the given system is stable.
 
 Many of these ODEs and DDEs can be reformulated as an integral equation. For a complicated system, the integral equation representation would seem to omit a lot of important structure and detail. However, it appears to be precisely this detail that makes Lyapunov's method fail when applied directly to the original equations. Conversion to a comparatively simple integral equation can allow the stability calculation to reach a successful conclusion.
 
 Some early progress on these ideas will be presented.
