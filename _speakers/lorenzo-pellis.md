## Multi-scale time-since-infection models in evolutionary epidemiology

The study of evolutionary epidemiology is vital to understand the complexity of pathogensâ€™ dynamics and their impact on public health, but is inherently challenging because pathogen evolution is driven by forces acting at multiple scales: for example, HIV needs to escape the immune system within a host, but also needs to maintain the ability to be transmitted efficiently between hosts. I will argue that time-since-infection models are much more flexible than ODEs if we want to allow for realistic enough aspects of both within- and between-host scales, but that capturing the feedback loops between such scales is a formidable challenge.
 
 Using HIV as an example, I will discuss current models and their limitations, with particular attention to the implications of the fundamental structural assumptions on models' behaviour. Furthermore, I will discuss the main technical challenges I see in developing a general theory for time-since-infection models that allow for superinfection (e.g. multi-strain systems with partial cross-immunity), starting from the problem of characterising the system's steady states.
