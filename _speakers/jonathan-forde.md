## Modeling the challenges of optimal resource deployment for epidemic prevention

During emergent outbreaks of viral infections, public health policy decisions are made on the basis of incomplete information in a changing landscape of scientific knowledge and budgetary and infrastructure constraints. Accounting for the trade-offs necessitated by the resource limitation is essential when formulating an optimal policy response. In this work, we pose optimal control problems to explore the implications of several such trade-off, focusing on testing vs. vaccination and long-term vs. short-term public health objectives. We also explore the how these optimal controls are influenced by the efficacy of the interventions and the frequency with which policy changes can be made.
