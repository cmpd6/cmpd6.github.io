## Addressing Waning Immunity Against Measles: Reevaluating the MMR Vaccination Program

In recent years, there have been some outbreaks of mumps and measles, and studies have suggested that waning vaccine-induced immunity could be a potential cause. Our project aims to enhance our understanding of the humoral response to measles vaccination and determine the optimal vaccination approach to mitigate future outbreaks. To accomplish this, we employ a set of delayed differential equations that accurately replicate the observed patterns in a longitudinal antibody titer data following the second MMR vaccine. We investigate the role of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells in the secondary humoral response, and also evaluate the impact of maternal antibodies on the vaccine efficacy.
