## The TME determines the efficacy of immunotherapies to treat glioblastoma

Glioblastoma is a deadly brain and central nervous system cancer for which standard-of-care only moderately extends survival. New treatment options, including immunotherapies, are under intense study but have so far failed to achieve efficacy in clinical trials. In this talk, I will show how agent-based modelling of glioblastoma and its tumour microenvironment combined with state-of-the-art experimental approaches provide important biological insight into the regulation of the immune response to oncolytic viruses and immune checkpoint blockade, pinpointing mechanisms of treatment success.
