## Resonance and bifurcation in a discrete-time predatorâ€“prey system 

This work studies bifurcation analysis and resonances in a discrete-time model analytically and numerically. The local stability conditions of all the fixed points in the system are determined. Here, codim-1 and codim-2 bifurcation, including multiple and generic bifurcations in the discrete model, are explored. The model undergoes fold bifurcation, flip bifurcation, Neimark-Sacker bifurcation and resonances bi-
furcation of codimension two at different fixed points. Using critical normal form theorem and bifurcation theory, this study obtains the normal form coefficients to confirm the nondegeneracy of codim-1 and codim-2 bifurcations in the model. The numerical simulation gives a wide range of periodic cycles and bifurcation in the system. In the system, NSB signifies that both species can fluctuate near critical parameter values and stable fluctuations seem. The resonance bifurcation in the discrete-time map indicates that both species coincide till order 4 in stable periodic cycles near some critical parametric
values.
